# Cursor AI Rules - GroandInvest MLM Platform

## Project Context
This is a USDT (TRC20) based MLM investment platform with referral system. All development must strictly follow the business rules defined in `PROJECT_RULES.md`.

## Critical Business Rules (MUST FOLLOW)

### Investment & Interest
- Minimum investment: 10 USDT
- Base daily interest: 0.50%
- Interest increases by 0.05% for every 10 direct active referrals
- Maximum interest cap: 2.00% per day
- Interest reinvestment is NOT allowed
- Special Investor Plan (10,000+ USDT): Fixed 1% daily interest, no referrals needed

### Withdrawal Rules
- Withdrawal locked until total investment reaches 500 USDT
- Once 500 USDT reached: Interest withdrawal unlocked, monthly cycle starts
- Minimum withdrawal: 20 USDT
- Maximum withdrawal: 30% of monthly interest
- One withdrawal per month only
- Processing within 24 hours
- Network/gas fee paid by user

### Referral Income
- ONLY applicable if referrer has minimum 500 USDT investment
- NOT paid in cash, NOT added to interest
- Directly added to investment balance only
- Percentage slabs: 10-49 (0.5%), 50-90 (1.0%), 91-120 (1.5%), 121-150 (2.0%), 151+ (3.0%)

### Authentication
- Mobile number with OTP verification
- One user = One account only
- Multiple accounts = Permanent freeze

### Safety Rules
- 60 days inactivity: Interest paused
- Large withdrawals: Manual admin approval
- Suspicious activity: Account review and hold

## Code Structure Rules

### Frontend Structure
- Auth pages (`/auth/*`): NO header, NO footer
- User pages (`/user/*`): User header + User footer
- Admin pages (`/admin/*`): Admin header only (no footer)

### File Organization
- Components: `/src/components/` (shared, auth, user, admin)
- Utils: `/src/utils/` (api, auth, calculations, validations)
- Context: `/src/context/` (AuthContext, UserContext)
- Hooks: `/src/hooks/` (useAuth, useUser)
- Middleware: `/src/middleware/` (auth, admin)

### Backend Structure
- Controllers: `/backend/controllers/`
- Services: `/backend/services/` (business logic)
- Schemas: `/backend/schemas/` (MongoDB models)
- Routes: `/backend/routes/`
- Middleware: `/backend/middleware/`

## Development Guidelines

### When Implementing Features
1. Always check `PROJECT_RULES.md` first
2. Validate business rules before coding
3. Test edge cases (500 USDT threshold, 10 referrals, etc.)
4. Ensure calculations match requirements exactly
5. Use CSS variables from `globals.css` for styling

### Calculation Functions
- Use `/src/utils/calculations.js` for frontend calculations
- Use `/backend/services/` for backend business logic
- All calculations must be transparent and match PROJECT_RULES.md

### API Endpoints
- Base URL: Use `process.env.API_URL` (localhost:3500 in dev)
- All endpoints must follow RESTful conventions
- Include proper error handling and validation

### Database Schema
- User: mobile (unique), totalInvestment, interestBalance, referralCode, etc.
- Investment: userId, amount, transactionHash, type (new/referral)
- Withdrawal: userId, amount, status, requestDate, processedDate
- Referral: referrerId, referredUserId, income, date

### Security
- Validate all inputs
- Sanitize database inputs
- Use JWT for authentication
- Protect routes with middleware
- Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints

### Error Handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Consistent error response format
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Don't expose sensitive information

## Styling Rules
- Use CSS variables from `globals.css`
- Color scheme: Navy blue (#4A5568), Dark purple (#6B46C1), Gray scale
- Minimal, modern, light theme
- Responsive design (mobile + desktop)

## Testing Requirements
Always test:
1. 500 USDT threshold (withdrawal unlock)
2. Referral income (500 USDT minimum requirement)
3. Interest calculation with referral bonuses
4. Monthly withdrawal limits
5. Special Investor Plan (10,000+ USDT)
6. Multiple account detection
7. Inactivity handling (60 days)

## Important Notes
- Interest is NOT compounded
- Referral income goes to investment balance, not wallet
- All calculations must be accurate and match PROJECT_RULES.md
- Keep code modular and maintainable
- Follow existing code style and patterns

## Reference Files
- Business Rules: `PROJECT_RULES.md`
- Environment Config: `.env` (root) and `backend/.env`
- Global Styles: `src/app/globals.css`
- Constants: `backend/utils/constants.js`
